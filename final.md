Information Problem: While food is essential to all human beings, nutritional needs are unique to each individual. With the millions of recipes in existence it is easy for someone to suffer from information overload trying to find something new to try that also fits their demands.

Stakeholders: The stakeholders would include the general public. Similiar to how Wikipedia works, we would depend on the users' donations that they would like to make. We would like to keep this web application stay free to all users and would appreciate the donation of any users so that our team could continue to put time and effort into the web application. 

Data: We chose to work with data from the Spoonacular API. The Spoonacular API consists of three different data categories: Menu items, products, and recipes. Of course, we used the recipes data for our web application due to the fact that it is essentially a searchable database of recipes. 

The Solution: We want to solve this problem by providing our stakeholders with a dedicated platform that allows them to search for recipes based on a variety of parameters. We created a web based application that will give users the ability to search through thousands of recipes based on certain criteria. This includes equipment needed, diet, meal type, intolerances, and more. 

Technical System: For our project, we hope to cover both iOS and Desktop. All members of our group members have iOS devices; therefore, it would be easier to target iOS devices and more difficult for us to test these web applications on androids or Windows computers. Most of us worked on the project using our MacBooks which is also anothe reason we decided to target iOS users. 

Challenges Faced: We had trouble figuring out how to implement the PUT and POST endpoints in particular. We also faced several challenges getting our team together so that we could equally put in effort and work into the project. In the end, we were able to get our project done in a timely matter after facing our challenges. 

Possible Future Work: The possible work we would do in the future to improve this web application is to create more customizable filters and add the option to create an account. This would include working on the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files. Overall, the website could have more style features added as well, making the web application look more visually and aesthetically pleasing.
