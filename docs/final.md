Information Problem: While food is essential to all human beings, nutritional needs are unique to each individual. When browsing thousands of recipes, someone can suffer from information overload as it can be hard to narrow down recipes that they are specifically looking for.

Stakeholders: The general public.

Target Browsers: Desktop and iOS.

Data: We chose to work with data provided through the Spoonacular API, which includes a large collection of recipes. We also chose to display data that provides relevant information about each recipe such as ingredients, preparation time and an image of the recipe.

The Solution: We want to solve this problem by providing our stakeholders with a dedicated platform that allows them to search for recipes based on a variety of parameters. We created a web based application that will give users the ability to search through thousands of recipes based on certain criteria. This includes equipment needed, diet, meal type, intolerances, and more. 

Technical System: For our project, we hope to cover both iOS and Desktop. All members of our group members have iOS devices; therefore, it would be easier to target iOS devices.

Challenges Faced: A lot of our challenges were faced when implementing the back-end portion of our project. In particular, we had trouble figuring out how to implement the PUT and POST endpoints.

Possible Future Work: Create more customizable filters and add the option to create an account to be able to store other forms of data relating to the user that can be used for search results.
