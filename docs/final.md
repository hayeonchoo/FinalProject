Information Problem: While food is essential to all human beings, nutritional needs are unique to each individual. With the millions of recipes in existence it is easy for someone to suffer from information overload trying to find something new to try that also fits their demands.

Stakeholders: The general public. 

Data: We chose to work with data from the Spoonacular API.

The Solution: We want to solve this problem by providing our stakeholders with a dedicated platform that allows them to search for recipes based on a variety of parameters. We created a web based application that will give users the ability to search through thousands of recipes based on certain criteria. This includes equipment needed, diet, meal type, intolerances, and more. 

Technical System: For our project, we hope to cover both iOS and Desktop. All members of our group members have iOS devices; therefore, it would be easier to target iOS devices.

Challenges Faced: We had trouble figuring out how to implement the PUT and POST endpoints in particular.

Possible Future Work: Create more customizable filters and add the option to create an account.
