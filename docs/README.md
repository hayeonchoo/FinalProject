** DEVELOPER MANUAL **
How to install application and all dependencies: Everything needed to run the application is included in the files turned in. The API is spoonacular. 

How to run application on a server: The link to our Heroku should be all you need to run this web application. 

How to run tests written for software: We did not create any test for this software; however, while we were developing the front-end and back-end of the web application, we utilized an open-source learning environment called Codepen.io and the inspect element aspect of Google Chrome. Codepen allowed us to test our code without having to build our application each time a change was made. By looking in the console part of inspect element, it allowed us to see whether or not our request to the API were successful or not.

The API - all GET, POST, PUT, etc endpoints, and what they each do: We utilized the Spoonacular API for this project. We used four GET endpoints from the API. One of them gets the information about the recipe, one of them gets the list of ingredients for the recipe, one of them gets the instructions of the recipe, and the last one gets a random recipe. we try to implement a POST endpoint that would analyze the recipe instructions; however, it seemed unncessary because the information that was going to be retrieved was the same as one of the GET endpoints. Finally, the Spoonacular API did not have any PUT endpoints. 

Known bugs: One of our features was to give to user three random recipes when they visit our homepage. On the desktop version of our web application, the different recipes show up as it is supposed to; however, on the mobile version of our application, the same three recipes shows up, which it is not supposed to.

Roadmap for future development: There are endless amount of customization that can be added to our web appliation. One example is to create a profile system for our stakeholders which will allow them to favorite recipes. Another example is for users to create meal plans, where they could drag and drop recipes that they will eat for the upcoming week. In the meal plan, it will give information amount the nutrients that is in the recipes to give the user the most amount of knowledge.
